## Sizing

## General Notes
First I create an index.html file and a CSS folder with a main.CSS file.
I boilerplate the index-file and add links to necessary stylesheets.
I also create a folder for resources and add all pictures and icons I will need for the project,
grouped into individual subfolders for better organization.

I use the stylesheet "Normalize.CSS" to reset the elements needed to make styling easier,
ensure a consistency between different browsers.

I set box-sizing to border-box globally and also to the pseudo-element ::before and ::after
to ensure an easier layout management.

I add all of the projects main colors and styles to the :root to reuse them easily throughout
the project and also change them out easily if needed.
